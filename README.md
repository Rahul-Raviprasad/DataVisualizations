# DataVisualizations
A repo for storing data visualization codes and examples

## Finding Data
There are many sources for data, here are a few data sources to play around with.
Many a times we will see that getting the data in a form that we can work with it in sckit-learn or other machine learning tools is quite difficult.
We will require Pandas and NumPy's help to get in a format that scikit-learn can consume.

### Data from Scikit-learn
They come in three flavors:
* Packaged Data: these small datasets are packaged with the scikit-learn installation, and can be downloaded using the tools in sklearn.datasets.load_*
* Downloadable Data: these larger datasets are available for download, and scikit-learn includes tools which streamline this process. These tools can be found in sklearn.datasets.fetch_*
* Generated Data: there are several datasets which are generated from models based on a random seed. These are available in the sklearn.datasets.make_*


## Data Visualization using D3
I am maintaining a separate repo for this.
